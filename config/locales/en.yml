  # Explanation
  explanation_bac: Total budget allocated to the project.
  explanation_sac: This is the original planned completion duration (date) of the project.
  explanation_pv: Total cost of the work scheduled/planned as of a reporting date.
  explanation_ev: Total cost of the work completed/performed as of a reporting date. When the progress rate is set, recorded on change date.
  explanation_es: This duration from the beginning of the project to the date on which the PV should have been equal to the current value of EV.
  explanation_ac: Total cost taken to complete the work as of a reporting date.
  explanation_at: This is the duration from the beginning of the project to status date.
  explanation_sv: Positive Schedule Variance Indicates we are ahead of schedule. Negative Schedule Variance Indicates we are behind of schedule.
  explanation_cv: Positive Cost Variance Indicates the project is under budget. Negative Cost Variance Indicates the project is over budget.
  explanation_tv: If TV value is negative, the project is behind schedule and if it is positive, it is ahead of schedule.
  explanation_spi: Above 1 indicates project team is very efficient in utilizing the time allocated to the project. Below 1 indicates project team is less efficient in utilizing the time allocated to the project.
  explanation_cpi: Above 1 indicates efficiency in utilizing the resources allocated to the project is good. Below 1 indicates efficiency in utilizing the resources allocated to the project is not good.
  explanation_cr: Project performance. SPI * CPI
  explanation_tpi: Time performance index, If TPI is greater than 1, then the project is ahead of schedule and if it is less than 1, then the project is behind schedule.
  explanation_complete: The percentage of work which was planned to be completed by the Reporting Date.
  explanation_eac: Estimate At Completion (EAC) is the estimated cost of the project at the end of the project.
  explanation_teac: The remaining work will be performed while maintaining the same rate of doing work for the rest of the project
  explanation_etc: The estimated cost required to complete the remainder of the project. (BAC－EV) / CPI
  explanation_vac: The variance on the total budget at the end of the project. BAC－EAC
  explanation_tvac: The Time Variance at Completion (TVAC) gives an indication of the estimated amount of time that the project will be completed ahead or behind schedule
  explanation_difference_end_date: Difference of plan at the end of day and forecast end of day.
  explanation_tcpi: Showing the efficiency at which the resources on the project should be utilized for the remainder of the project.
